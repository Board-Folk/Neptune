# STL Files

These files are simple spacers to allow the power and reset buttons supplied
with DVIZIX's Neptune case to be used with this PCB. They are intentionally
slightly oversized such that they may be trimmed down to achieve the optimal
length. For this reason, it is recommended to print them with 100% infill
(or at least for the bottom couple of millimeters).

Tip: Placing small springs of around 5-6mm diameter by 10mm long in the recess
between the buttons and the main shell will also improve the action/feel of
the buttons.
